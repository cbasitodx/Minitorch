# 🔥 Minitorch: A Tiny Pytorch Clone for Learning Deep Learning Frameworks

Welcome to **Minitorch**! 🎉 This project is an academic Pytorch clone designed to help you dive deep into the mathematics, design choices, and programming challenges behind the famous Deep Learning & Tensors framework, Pytorch.

## 🌟 What is Minitorch?

Minitorch is a lightweight framework created for educational purposes. Its goal is to give you a solid understanding of the foundational concepts in deep learning, by allowing you to:

- 🧠 Grasp the **underlying mathematics** behind tensors and neural networks.
- 🛠️ Explore **design choices** made in a deep learning framework.
- 💻 Tackle **programming intricacies** involved in building such a system from scratch.

## 🚀 Features

- **Tensors**: Support for vector and matrix mathematical operations 🧮.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Implementations of algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) 🔄.
- **Automatic Differentiation Engine**: Build and compute gradients automatically for training neural networks 🧮✨.
- **Neural Network Components**:
  - **Linear Layer**: Fully connected neural network layer.
  - **Activation Functions**: Classes like Sigmoid, ReLU, and more! 🔌⚡.
  - **Loss functions**: Loss functions for computing your network loss, such as Binary Cross Entropy! 🤖​

## 📝 Example

Minitorch comes with an example notebook where you can train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to learn the AND logic function. 🤖💡

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Building the project is simple! Here's how to get started:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cbasitodx/Minitorch.git
   cd minitorch
   ```

2. Build your virtual enviroment for generating documentation (right now only available to make users 🐧​)
   ```bash
    make env
   ```

## Prerequisites
* make tool installed 🐧.
* Python 3.x installed 🐍.

## 📚 Documentation

Full documentation can be automatically generated with the make doc command. Explore the intricacies of the framework and dive deep into the code! 📖🔍 Just make sure to first run ```make env```
